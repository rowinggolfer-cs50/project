# project
Final Project for CS50

For my final project, I wanted to combine what I have learned on the 
Android track with a real-life django website I build for my work as
a dentist.

# the implementation

This is in 3 parts.
1. An interactive website with a database backend.
2. A refresher on how to initiate such a website using Python3.8, 
   Django3.0.4, and sandbox that python environment using virtualenv.
   I wrote this up as a tutorial.
3. An example of an AJAX call using jquery.load() to search for records.

# the necessity

The Covid-19 pandemic changed dentistry in the UK into a telephone 
only service for advice/analgesics/antimicrobrials. Only serious cases
would be referred onto government run clinics where extraordinary
measures were to be taken to prevent exascerbation of the pandemic.

I work within a team of 9 dentists, and we agreed a rota to field calls
from our patients.
This created a need for a shareable notes system. Annoyingly, this
could not be provided by the prioprietary software used in out practices.

So I developed a django website to do this for us. It worked well and
10 weeks in we have responded to over 400 patients requiring our help.

This project provides the full source code for that website, presented 
as a django app. 

# demo website
