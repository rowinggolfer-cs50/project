<h2>
Virtualenv
</h2>
venv.html
<p>
Create a virtualenv for python.
<br />
This is sensible as it helps keep your system's python environment clean.
A virtualenv is created by default without any access to site-packages
and other locally installed modules. This is useful.
<br />
This also ensures you are aware what third party modules you have used,
which is essential for deployment of your django project to a server
</p>
<h4>
examples in creating a virtualenv
</h4>
<p>
(choose which python to "clone" )
</p>
<pre>
me@my-comp ~/project $ virtualenv venv
OR
me@my-comp ~/project $ virtualenv -p python3 venv
OR
me@my-comp ~/project $ virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.8 venv
</pre>

<p>
now the project directory looks like this.
(tree is a nice tool for seeing directory structures. -L flag indicates depth)
</p>
<pre>
me@my-comp ~/project $ tree -L 2
.
└── venv
    ├── bin
    ├── include
    ├── lib
    └── share
</pre>

<p>
start your virtual environment and check that the correct python is in use.
</p>
<pre>
me@my-comp ~/project $ source venv/bin/activate

(venv) me@my-comp ~/project $ which python
me@my-comp ~/project/venv/bin/python
</pre>
<p>
<h4>
Note
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
"(venv)" reassures us that we are in a python virtual environment.
</li>
<li>
the executable returned by "which python" confirms it.
</li>
</ul>
