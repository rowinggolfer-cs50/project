You are probably thinking that Django is a lot of work to achieve what an old
fashioned web directory could do in a few minutes.
<br />
<strong>
    I couldn't agree more!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
However, the addition of a database along with django's powerful template system
and some of the built in functionality such as the login system, the advantages
soon become apparent.

<p>
Also, once you have a few django websites up and running, if you have coded
your websites well, you should be able to "share" apps between them.
