<p>
Now we are ready to run the django test server, and visit the 
website it produces in our web-browser.
<br />
to do this, cd into the new cs50 directory and run the command
"python manage.py runserver" (something we will be doing a lot!)
</p>
<pre>
(venv) me@my-comp ~/project $ cd cs50
(venv) me@my-comp ~/project/cs50 $ python manage.py runserver

open a webbrowser and navigate to 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>
