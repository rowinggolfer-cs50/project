Enhancing Security
</h2>

<p>
<h3>settings.py</h3>
<p>
A starter for examining the security of your website is to look at the
settings.py file created by the django-admin script.
<br />
You will notice there are 2 security warnings in this file.
</p>
<h4>WARNING 1</h4>
<p>
<code>
# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!                                 
<br />
SECRET_KEY = 'tm@j(u-=tv(hpxt-@_5nf(zxi!88*6t79ay2ksohvbip=4e2)d'                                  
</code>
</p>

Your SECRET_KEY will be different to mine, but I have made 2 errors already.
<ol>
    <li>
I have shown you mine!
    </li>
    <li>
I have put settings.py under version control, so it is also recorded there!
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
The SECRET_KEY is used by django for cryptographic functions, such as session
cookies, password resets etc. You can also use it in combination with django's
built in functionality to encrypt data, files etc.
<br />
Therefore once in production, it could be problematic to change this.
</p>
<p>
If you are never going to share your code, don't worry about this. I would
suggest, however, that it is a good idea to create a separate folder named
"secrets" and keep this out of your version control etc.
(either add secrets/ to .gitignore, or put it somewhere else entirely)
<br />
As your website grows, you will almost certainly accrue extra "secrets", such as
api keys for paypal etc ... 
<br />
<br />
replace the code in settings.py with something like
<pre>
    # Use a separate file for the secret key
    with open('/path/to/secrets/secret_key.txt') as f:
        SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
</pre>

(to generate a new secret key use the following python code)
<p>
<code>
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
<br />
get_random_secret_key()
</code>
</p>

<h4>WARNING 2</h4>
Here's another warning.
<p>
<code>
# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!                                  
<br />
DEBUG = True   
</code>
</p>
<strong>
Mark my words, ONE DAY YOU WILL FORGET TO CHANGE THIS!.
So do it immediately!
</strong>
My chosen way is to have django recognise when it is running on my development
machine, and if it isn't (ie. it is on a webserver somewhere) then default to
DEBUG = False.
<br />
So put something like this into settings.py
<pre>
    import socket
    if socket.gethostname() == 'my-comp':
        DEBUG = True
    else:
        DEBUG = False
</pre>

Incidentally - for deployment, there are further settings which will be updated here
(ALLOWED_HOSTS is one example - that cannot be blank if DEBUG is False), hence
using the obvious one liner is discouraged.  
</p>
