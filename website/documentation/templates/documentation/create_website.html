<h2>
Create Your Website with Django.
</h2>
03.html
<p>
Finally - we are ready to start our django website ("project").
<br />
<em>
    (My project is called simply "cs50")
</em>
</p>
<pre>
        (venv) me@my-comp ~/project $ django-admin startproject cs50
</pre>

<p>
this will create a directory cs50 with the following contents
<br />
(We will examine these files later.)
</p>

<pre>
        (venv) me@my-comp ~/project (master #%) $ tree cs50/
        cs50/
        ├── cs50
        │   ├── asgi.py
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── settings.py
        │   ├── urls.py
        │   └── wsgi.py
        ├── manage.py
        └── db.sqlite3

1 directory, 7 files
</pre>

<h4>
1 directory, 7 files
</h4>
<p>
Let's just take a look at what django has provided
out of the box.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Note: We have 2 folders called cs50.
</em>
<br />
cs50 is simply the PROJECT_NAME I chose when running 
<pre> django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME
</pre>
having 2 such folders is good design, which will become clear one we start our
"apps", however it does lead to some unavoidable ambiguity in this documentation.
<br />
I will differentiate by referring to the parent directory as "root cs50".
</p>

<h4>
    Files and Subfolders in "root cs50"
</h4>
in the "root cs50"  folder, we have 2 files and a folder.
<h5>
SubFolder - cs50
</h5>
<p>
in this "project cs50" folder, we have 5 files.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt> __init__.py</dt>
    <dd>
        this file is blank - but confirms that this directory is an importable 
        python package
    </dd>
    <dt>
        asgi.py and wsgi.py
    </dt>
    <dd>
        These files are used for deploying to webservers. wsgi has been around for
        years. asgi is a new emerging standard (with with I am unfamiliar).
        We don't really need to touch these files, although it can be useful to put code
        therein to confirm you are in a deployed environment and overwrite some
        settings. But we are not at that stage yet, so we can leave them alone!
    </dd>
    <dt>
        urls.py
    </dt>
    <dd>
        out of the box, django has one url pattern in this file.
        <br />
        <code>
        urlpatterns = [path('admin/', admin.site.urls),]     
        </code>
        <br />
        urls.py is where we build our hyperlinks for the website.
        this default file will catch 
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
    </dd>
<dt>
settings.py.
</dt>
<dd>
This file is extremely important, and must be configured correctly for oue new
website to function correctly and securely.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>
<h5>
File 1 - db.sqlite3
</h5>
<p>
Our sqlite3 database. For a small website, sqlite is good fit, as it makes for
very easy deployment. django can use a variety of industry standard databases
such as postgresql, mariadb and mysql, but that is beyond the scope of this
project. 
<br />

     - more details about how django uses databases and sqlite3
    </a>
</p>
<h5>
File 2 - manage.py      
</h5>
<p>
This is an important file, by used only by the developer.
<br />
A full list of commands you can issue with manage.py can be found by issuing the
command.
</p>
<pre>
    (venv) me@my-comp ~/project $ python manage.py help
    Type 'manage.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
    Available subcommands:
    [auth]
        changepassword
        createsuperuser
