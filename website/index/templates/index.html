<h2>
    CS50 Final Project
</h2>
<p>
    This website introduces the final project of Neil Wallace for the Harvard
    University CS50 introduction to computing course 2020.
</p>
<h4>
    Project Aim
</h4>
<p>
    I am a dentist, who was prevented from contact with patients during the
    strict United Kingdom's covid-19 lockdown of April-July 2020.
    During this period, my colleagues and I shared responsibility for triaging
    telephone conversations from patients with problems. We needed a way to
    record and share this information.
    My final project, therefore, documents the website I created to provide a 
    secure online database frontend.
<br />
<em>
    For obvious reasons I am unable to share the intranet version of the site
    which contains sensitive information and patient details etc... However I
    can confirm it worked very well and my colleagues used it to the great
    benefit of and patients.
</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Tools used.
</h4>
<p>
    The website uses the 
    <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python programming language</a>, 
    and the 
    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django Web Framwork</a>.
    <br />
    The database used in production was 
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>
    <br />
    <em>
    NB. for this demonstration version of the website I am using the
    lightweight
    <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html" target="_blank">sqllite3 database</a>
    which was introduced during the problem set 7 of the CS50 course.
