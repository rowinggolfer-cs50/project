Currently our "website" has a holding page
http://127.0.0.1:8000

and an admin page which requests a username and password
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

However we have no users in our database, so username and password does not
exist.
So perhaps a logical next step is to create ourselves a user.
This is done using the following command.


(venv) me@my-comp ~/project/cs50 (master) $ python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'neil'): admin
Email address: rowinggolfer@gmail.com        
Password: 
Password (again): 
Superuser created successfully.

this updates the database and we can now login.

as the database has changed, time to do another git commit.


Now - finally, we can move on to creating some content.
