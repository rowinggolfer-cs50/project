At this stage we have a working website, and access to the django admin app.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

the next step may well be to allow users to create accounts on the site, setting
and modifying passwords, functionality for password recovery, 2 stage
authentication etc...

However, that is beyond the scope of what I am doing within my project, so to
allow a VERY simple login system I am just going to resuse the LoginView and
LogoutView provided by the auth system. This means that only I, using the admin
app and the superuser I created, can add users. This suffices for the site I am
about to create, which is an application for holding patient data for myelf and
dental colleagues during the corona lockdown where we need to work at home.

To do this I need to alter 3 files.

cs50/urls.py
index/templates/index.html 
settings.py

1. urls.py
    
    # Add the following imports.

    from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView, LogoutView
    
    # and add these two paths to urlpatterns.

    path('login/', LoginView.as_view(template_name='admin/login.html'), name="my-login"),
    path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(), name="my-logout"),


the whole file should now look like this.

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView, LogoutView
    from django.urls import path
    from django.urls import include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', include('index.urls')),
        path('login/', LoginView.as_view(template_name='admin/login.html'),
            name="my-login"),
        path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(), name="my-logout"),
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

2. index.html

    # insert some logic into the template to show different text to 
    # a logged in user.
    

    <h1>It Works!</h1>
    {% if user.is_authenticated %}
        Hello {{ user.username }}.<br />
        Thanks for logging in.<br />
        <a href="{% url 'my-logout' %}">Logout</a>
    {% else %}
        Please <a href="{% url 'my-login' %}">Login</a>
    {% endif %}

3. settings.py
    # to ensure users are directed back to our homepage, we have to change some
    # default variables.
    # append this to the bottom of the file. 

    LOGIN_URL = 'my-login'
    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "homepage"
    LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "homepage"

That's it. I can log in using my superuser credentials, and log out again.
Once logged in I can create other username/password "normal" users by visiting 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/user/add/

That's really it for the basic site. I am ready to start adding other apps. I am
going to add 2 apps. "tutorial" which explains what I have done and "dentist"
which will become my database of dental notes.
