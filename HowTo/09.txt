Covid django app.

As a dentist in Scotland, the covid-19 virus brought my business to a close.
This is why I started on the cs50 course!

However, it also created a need for some new software. We had to set up a dental
helpline and take calls from patients, making notes, and having those notes
available for all team-members.

Here's how I did it.

    (venv) ~/my-website $ python manage.py startapp covid

and integrate this new app into my project.

1. add to the main project urls.py urlpatterns
    path('covid', include('covid.urls')),

    NOTE - (covid.urls does not yet exist!)

2. add "covid" to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

3. put a link to the covid homepage from our index homepage.

    <a href="{% url 'covid-homepage' %}">
        Covid Dental Notes
    </a>

4. create urls.py in the covid app.

    '''
    urls.py for my cs50 covid django-app
    '''
    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name="covid-homepage"),
    ]

5. edit covid/views.py
    NOTE - templates for this new app use a directory structure to prevent
    collisions.
    
    '''
    views.py for cs50 project covid app
    '''
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView

    class IndexView(TemplateView):
        template_name = "covid/index.html"

6. create that template dir.
    (venv) ~/my-website $ mkdir -p covid/templates/covid

7. create a template covid/templates/covid/index.html

    {% extends 'base.html' %}

    {% block content %}
    <h4>Covid Homepage</h4>
    {% endblock %}

8. run the test server to check all is well.
